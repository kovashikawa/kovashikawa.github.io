Adding a favicon to your Jekyll site is a simple way to personalize your website and make it easily recognizable in browser tabs and bookmarks.

## What is a Favicon?

A favicon is a small icon that appears next to your siteâ€™s title in browser tabs, bookmarks, and on mobile devices. It helps users quickly identify your site among many open tabs.

## How to Add a Favicon in Minimal Mistakes

1. **Generate Favicons:**  
- Use [RealFaviconGenerator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/) to create a .zip of the set of favicon images and files for your site. 
- Just upload the picture you want there and they will do the rest of the work for you.

2. **Add Favicon Files:**  
- Place the generated favicon files in your site's `assets/images/favicon/` directory.

3. **Insert Favicon Links:**  
- Edit `_includes/head/custom.html` and add the following lines:

   ```html
   <!-- Favicons -->
   <link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="/assets/images/favicon/favicon-96x96.png" sizes="96x96" />
   <link rel="icon" type="image/svg+xml" href="/assets/images/favicon/favicon.svg" />
   <link rel="shortcut icon" href="/assets/images/favicon/favicon.ico" />
   <link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="180x180" href="/assets/images/favicon/apple-touch-icon.png" />
   <link rel="manifest" href="/assets/images/favicon/site.webmanifest" />
   ```

4. **Preview Your Favicon:**  
- After rebuilding your site, open it in your browser. You should see your custom favicon in the tab, like this:

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="/assets/images/favicon/favicon-96x96.png" alt="Favicon Example">
</div>

## Final Result

Your site will now display your chosen favicon across browsers and devices, giving it a professional and unique touch!

Bonus point, you can save it to your iphone's home page and it can look something like this:

<img src="/assets/images/iphone_homepage.jpeg" alt="Iphone Example" style="max-width: 300px; display: block; margin: 1em auto;">
